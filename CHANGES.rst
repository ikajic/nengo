   - Bugfixes
   - Documentation

2.1.0 (unreleased)
==================

**API changes**

- Spiking ``LIF`` neuron models now accept an additional argument,
  ``min_voltage``. Voltages are clipped such that they do not drop below
  this value (previously, this was fixed at 0).
  (`#666 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/666>`_)
- ``Process`` objects can now be passed directly as node outputs,
  making them easier to use. The ``Process`` interface is also improved
  and is currently the same as the ``Synapse`` interface. However,
  further improvements are pending, and the current implementation
  SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED!
  (`#652 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/652>`_)

**Behavioural changes**

- The ``probeable`` attribute of all Nengo objects is now implemented
  as a property, rather than a configurable parameter.
  (`#671 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/671>`_)
- Node functions receive ``x`` as a copied NumPy array (instead of a readonly
  view).
  (`#716 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/716>`_,
  `#722 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/722>`_)

**Improvements**

- ``EnsembleArray.add_output`` now accepts a list of functions
  to be computed by each ensemble.
  (`#562 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/562>`_,
  `#580 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/580>`_)
- Added ``SqrtBeta`` distribution, which describes the distribution
  of semantic pointer elements.
  (`#414 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/414>`_,
  `#430 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/430>`_)
- Added ``Triangle`` synapse, which filters with a triangular FIR filter.
  (`#660 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/660>`_)
- Added ``utils.connection.eval_point_decoding`` function, which
  provides a connection's static decoding of a list of evaluation points.
  (`#700 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/700>`_)
- Resetting the Simulator now resets all Processes, meaning the
  injected random signals and noise are identical between runs,
  unless the seed is changed (which can be done through
  ``Simulator.reset``).
  (`#582 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/582>`_,
  `#616 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/616>`_,
  `#652 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/652>`_)

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed issue where setting ``Connection.seed`` through the constructor had
  no effect. (`#724 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/725>`_)
- Fixed issue when probing scalar transforms.
  (`#667 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/667>`_,
  `#671 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/671>`_)
- Fix for SPA actions that route to a module with multiple inputs.
  (`#714 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/714>`_)

2.0.1 (January 27, 2015)
========================

**Behavioural changes**

- Node functions receive ``t`` as a float (instead of a NumPy scalar)
  and ``x`` as a readonly NumPy array (instead of a writeable array).
  (`#626 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/issues/626>`_,
  `#628 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/628>`_)

**Improvements**

- ``rasterplot`` works with 0 neurons, and generates much smaller PDFs.
  (`#601 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/601>`_)

**Bug fixes**

- Fix compatibility with NumPy 1.6.
  (`#627 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo/pull/627>`_)

2.0.0 (January 15, 2015)
========================

Initial release of Nengo 2.0!
Supports Python 2.6+ and 3.3+.
Thanks to all of the contributors for making this possible!
